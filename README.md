### The Odin Project HTML recipes project

This project demonstrates a basic HTML website with links and images.

I used standard HTML 5 to create a recipes site with a homepage with an list of recipes with links to their respective pages.

Each recipe page has an image, a variety of headings and an unordered and ordered list of items for the recipe ingredients and instructions.

The end of the page links back to the homepage of recipes.
